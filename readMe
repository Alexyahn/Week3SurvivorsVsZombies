Problem Statement:
This program is a scenario in which there is a zombie virus that is going around the population.
There is a world with both zombies and survivors. The goal of the program is to generate a random
number
of zombies and survivors. There are different types of each- Strong(Tank)/weak(Common infected)
zombies and Stronger to weaker(Soldier/teacher/child) survivors.
The program is to have these &quot;people&quot; interact with one another and use their characteristics to
replicate a &quot;survival
of the fittest&quot; scenario. The program then finishes when either only zombies or only survivors are left.
